# Buildifier Formatting Fixture

This fixture contains a valid Tiltfile with formatting issues that buildifier should fix:
- Unsorted load statements
- Inconsistent spacing and indentation
- Poor list and dictionary formatting
- Extra whitespace in function definitions

Should pass syntax checks but need buildifier formatting.
