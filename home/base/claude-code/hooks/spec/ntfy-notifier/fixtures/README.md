# ntfy-notifier Fixtures

The ntfy-notifier hook primarily tests configuration and JSON input processing, so it doesn't require extensive file-based fixtures. 

Most test scenarios are handled through:
- Environment variable configuration
- JSON input via stdin
- Mock commands for curl

The fixtures here are minimal and mainly serve as placeholders for consistency with the test structure.
