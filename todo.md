# TODO List - Current Status

> **Last Updated**: January 2025  
> **Status**: Major cleanup and reorganization completed

## ✅ Recently Completed (2025)

### Architecture & Organization
- [x] **Removed duplicate Neovim configurations** - Consolidated to single `home/base/editors/neovim/`
- [x] **Fixed hardcoded paths in configurations** - All paths now use proper relative imports
- [x] **Cleaned up helper functions** - `my-lib/default.nix` streamlined, removed unused functions
- [x] **Centralized timezone configuration** - All timezone settings use `vars/default.nix`
- [x] **Removed all TODO items from codebase** - No remaining TODOs found in .nix files
- [x] **Added comprehensive input validation** - `vars/default.nix` has assertions for all critical variables
- [x] **Optimized package imports** - `flake.nix` uses `mkPkgs` helper function for consistent package sets
- [x] **Consolidated module organization** - Clean structure with `home/base/` for shared, platform-specific in `home/darwin/`
- [x] **Cleaned up module directory** - Removed unused VM modules, empty package files, and broken configurations
- [x] **Simplified NixOS host structure** - Merged redundant files, flattened directory structure
- [x] **Enhanced proxy configuration** - Added dual-mode support (local/network) for both shell and nix-daemon
- [x] **Updated documentation** - CLAUDE.md and ARCHITECTURE.md reflect current state
- [x] **Implemented shared fonts configuration** - `modules/common/fonts.nix` successfully created and deployed
- [x] **Removed duplicate Starship configuration files** - Deleted `_disable.nix` and `_original.nix` backup files
- [x] **Removed outdated req_doc.md** - Deleted completed shared fonts configuration task file

### Build System & Testing
- [x] **Implemented comprehensive build testing** - Added `safe-build`, `build-test`, validation pipeline
- [x] **Added generation management** - Rollback capabilities and emergency recovery
- [x] **Stepwise development methodology** - Documented incremental approach for complex configurations

## 🔄 Current Tasks

### Documentation Cleanup (Low Priority)
- [ ] **Fix minor naming inconsistency in host files** (Optional)
  - Issue: `hosts/darwin/rorschach.nix` uses lowercase, while `NightOwl.nix` and `SilkSpectre.nix` use capitalized names
  - Action: Rename `rorschach.nix` to `Rorschach.nix` for consistency (requires updating flake.nix reference)
  - Priority: Very Low (cosmetic only - all references work correctly)
  - Estimated effort: 3 minutes

### Remaining Items
- [ ] **Hardware Integration: `sudo batt activate` script**
  - Location: Needs integration into build scripts or system activation
  - Priority: Low (hardware-specific for battery management)
  - Action: Evaluate if needed for current setup

### Future Enhancements (Low Priority)
- [ ] **Security Hardening**
  - Add timeout controls to TouchID sudo configuration
  - Evaluate personal data exposure in version control
  
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**
  - Tree-sitter grammar loading optimization (specify only needed grammars)
  - Review large package import efficiency
  
- [ ] **Advanced Features**
  - Host-specific override mechanism for per-machine customization
  - Automated dependency update pipeline
  - CI/CD for configuration validation
